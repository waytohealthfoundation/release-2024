        "Lisa O'Brien: Meet Lisa, the heart and soul behind Way to Health. With
        30 years of nursing under her belt, she's not just our founder and
        President but also your go-to person for all things caring and
        compassionate. Lisa's journey with Way to Health started with her first
        mission trip to Haiti in 2014, and the rest, as they say, is history.
      </p>
      <p>
        After lots of prayers and a hefty dose of determination, Way to Health
        officially took flight in 2016. Lisa's been fearlessly leading medical
        missions all over Haiti since then, but her heart found a special place
        in the vibrant communities of Cite Soleil. It's become the heartbeat of
        Way to Health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having Lisa in your life means inevitably catching the Way to Health bug
        because her passion and Godly heart are just too contagious to resist."
        "Jule McFarland: Meet Julie, our detail-oriented and heartfelt prayer
        warrior. She's been an essential part of the Way to Health family since
        its founding in 2016, serving with passion on the Board of Directors. As
        our Vice President, Julie spearheads some of our most impactful
        projects, with the latest gem being the Malnourished Baby Feeding
        Initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, Julie took a leap of faith and joined her first mission trip.
        Being on the ground, seeing the direct impact of the work she and the
        Board contribute, changed her perspective forever. Julie hasn't been the
        same since that eye-opening experience, and her dedication to our cause
        shines through in everything she does." "Sarah Dray: Introducing Sarah,
        the multitasking force behind Way to Health—our Secretary and the newly
        appointed Director of Humanitarian Initiatives. Just like Julie, Sarah
        has been a dedicated part of our journey since the beginning in 2016,
        eagerly volunteering for a variety of projects that come her way.
      </p>
      <p>
        With numerous trips to Haiti under her belt, Sarah discovered her
        passion for healthcare on her very first visit. When in Haiti, you'll
        likely spot S arah at the forefront, orchestrating our mobile medical
        clinics. Her commitment to quality and team safety takes the top spot on
        her priority list." "Gail Howard: Say hello to Gail, our newest
        superstar on the Way to Health Board of Directors! Gail's been part of
        the Way to Health family for a while, and in 2022, she officially
        stepped into her role as a Director. What makes Gail stand out? It's her
        out-of-the-box thinking and that awesome businesswoman mindset—making
        her the perfect addition to our Director team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though Gail hasn't been on a mission trip (yet!), her passion and
        joy shine through in everything she does with Way to Health. And here's
        the best part—she's got her friends and family right alongside her,
        making every step of the journey a shared adventure."

        Your donations make a significant impact in our healthcare efforts in Haiti. They support the hiring of Haitian medical professionals, purchase of medications and supplies, and engagement of translators and security personnel.

On clinic days, our team, comprising in-country doctors and nurses, provides care to 100-250 patients daily via mobile medical clinics. Nurses take vital signs, doctors diagnose, and prescribed medications come with a 20-day supply and guidance. We also distribute reading glasses when available.

Our healthcare addresses various conditions like Tuberculosis, Typhoid, Cholera, Pneumonia, Bronchitis, Intestinal Worms, Malnourishment, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. For infants, the common causes of death—dehydration and fever—can be treated with a simple antibiotic.

In cases where patients can't reach the clinic, our mission team travels with medical supplies to provide on-site care. Way to Health operates entirely with volunteers, and your donations directly support the purchase of medications, supplies, and in-country medical assistance, making a meaningful impact on those we serve.
