        <h3>MATCHING DONATION PROGRAMS</h3>
        <p>
          Looking to maximize the impact of your donation? Inquire with your
          employer about their donation matching program! When you contribute
          to Way to Health through this initiative, your employer will
          automatically double your donation using their funds. If Way to
          Health is not currently among the nonprofits your company supports,
          reach out to us. We can work together to join their matching
          donations program, ensuring your donation goes even further. Supply
          EIN number. "Here is everything you will need for your employer to
          partner with WTH..."Currently, we have partnerships with HCA and the
          Shell Oil Foundation. If you'd like to see your employer join in to
          double your donation, encourage them to connect with us! Contact
          information
