          Contact us for the next scheduled trip. Missionaries pay their own
          travel expenses, food, lodging and water. Mission travel is eight
          days. Trip itineraries are planned months in advance to ensure a
          successful trip for the poor. Health and business professionals
          put their skills to the test in mobile medical clinics, working
          alongside and training the poor.
