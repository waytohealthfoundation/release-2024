Giving Tuesday, November 28, 2023
Participate in Giving Tuesday by supporting Way to Health, enabling us to sustain crucial care for the underprivileged. A mere $1 can furnish medicine for a malnourished baby, potentially saving their life. Your contribution makes a significant impact on those in need.
 
Expansion of the Malnourished Baby Feeding Initiative
As we conclude 2023, unite with us to broaden our feeding initiative. We aim to extend the feeding program from 34 malnourished babies to 90, reaching more communities by expanding into additional neighborhoods in Cite Soleil, Haiti.
